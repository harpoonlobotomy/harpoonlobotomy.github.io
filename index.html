<h1>Baldur's Gate Forensics</h1>

<p>Collection debug:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Found {{ site.fieldnotes | size }} fieldnotes</li>
  <li>Environment: {{ jekyll.environment }}</li>
</ul>



<p>Figuring out how it all works, reconstructing materials, parsing LSX files and animating Intellect Devourers in Blender.</p>

<p>Just somewhere to keep my notes on the various workings of BG3 files and assets. Having spent quite a few weeks neck deep in GR2s and LSXs, it'd be nice to make it available to someone else if it might be useful.</p>

<h3>Fieldnotes</h3>

<ul>
{% for note in site.fieldnotes %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a> â€” 
    <small>{{ note.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</small>
    <p>{{ note.excerpt }}</p>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
