title: BG3 Material Forensics
---

<p>Figuring out how it all works, reconstructing materials, parsing LSX and LSMG files, and animating Intellect Devourers in Blender.</p>

<p><small>Just somewhere to keep my notes on the various workings of BG3 files and assets. Having spent quite a few <s>weeks</s> months neck deep in GR2s and LSXs, it'd be nice to make it available to someone else if it might be useful.</small></p>
